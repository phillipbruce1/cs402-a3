# Assignment 2

Phillip Bruce CS 402

## Overview

This app is designed to be a simple, intuitive todo list.

## Function

There is a "plus" button in the lower right corner of the screen to add a new task. You can check
said task off to mark it as done, or tap on the text box to edit it. You can select tasks by
long-pressing on the checkbox, then select any of the options from the overflow menu in the top
right corner of the screen.

## Challenges

I ran into frequent challenges during this project. Between learning the Kotlin syntax, to Android
development as a whole, and everything in between, this was a new experience for me. Plus, I had to
turn in this assignment late due to other homework and marching band. All in all though, I learned a
lot from this project with how mobile applications work.
